# July 24th, 2015

**Attendees:** @tkellen, @dgeb

**Discussion:** http://discuss.jsonapi.org/t/json-api-weekly-meeting-july-24th-2015/63

## Agenda

### Determine how we want to handle alpha/beta/release versioning.

  * Website will always show current stable version by default.
  * Version number on header will become a dropdown showing all stable versions as well as the current alpha/beta. The dropdown will allow for toggling between versions.

### Determine what's needed to get the discussion around embedding and side-posting started
  * Source issue: [#795](https://github.com/json-api/json-api/issues/795)
  * @dgeb will kick off the discussion in the aforementioned issue with the list of requirements we've drawn up.

### Add optional support for top level `version` key in resource objects to indicate versioning.
  * Source issue: [#600]( https://github.com/json-api/json-api/issues/600)
  * @dgeb and @tkellen are +1 to adding this.
  * Unless @ethanresnick or @steveklabnick object, we will add normative support for this in 1.1 alpha.
  * We can't add this "officially" until the website supports versioning.
